# Goals


## Tooling

A critical component of this thesis should explore novel methods and approaches made possible by modern computing and software tools.  Data should be explicitly modeled, testable and re-usable.

## Accessibility

Academic literature has traditionally posed significant barriers to engagement.  To those outside a domain, dependency chains for understanding a piece can be signicant enough to avoid consuming academic artifacts.  Even to colleagues within a domain, reproducibility and open data access can make it difficult to engage with literature.

This thesis aims to produce three primary artifacts to address historic barriers to accessibility:

1.  A formal thesis in line with the format, tone and culture of a traditional master's thesis.
2.  A free and open access point to both data and code used and to the extent possible a fully reproducible pipeline that can be audited and scrutinized.
3.  A public, dynamic HTTP interface that should distill and synthesize the main points of the thesis in an interactive and visual format that can be reasonably consumed by non-experts, but engaging to expert readers as well.
