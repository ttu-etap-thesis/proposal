# Primer

About a third of all transportation energy usage is driven by personal mobility.  This includes the U.S. light duty vehicle (LDV) fleet used for commerce, work, escort, leisure travel.  The transportation network in the United States is meant to support the free movement of people and goods.  Technology changes in both transportation and ubiquitous networked communication are drastically changing mobility concepts. 

##  Areas

- Equity distributions around vehicle electrification.  Who gets left behind? Economic development?
- Transportation in non-hyper-urban regions.
- What is the future of transportation of areas that are not-densely populated?
- What are transportation patterns for non-urban areas?

## New Mobility

New mobility refers to a modernization of existing transportation systems meant to increase efficiency and reliability.  The following transportation concepts are associated with new mobility:

- Mobility-as-a-service and Mobility on Demand
    - Shared vehicles
    - Ride-hailing and Transportation Network Companies (TNCs)
    - Micro-transit services (e.g. Chariot)
    - Demand-responsive public service (e.g. AC Transit Flex)
    - Carpooling marketplaces and platforms
- Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS)
- Transit oriented housing (TOD) and Multi-use Zoning
- Autonomous Vehicles

Mobility is being re-imagined as a fundamentally integrated, multi-modal experience that moves beyond single-ownership vehicles.  Decarbonization is accomplished via technology measures, e.g. greening the fleet, reducing transportation demand and increasing efficiency of existing transportation networks through new mobility.


### Problem Statement

Many new mobility concepts are not practical outside of urban metropolitan areas.  Many of the benefits are distributed primarily in urban metropolitan areas.  Many micropolitan zones have seen decreasing economic mobility and prosperity in recent decades.  Existing transportation decarb measures fail to address mobility challenges in micropolitan zones.  

### Thesis Ideas and Concepts

- What are the major mobility challenges in micropolitan zones? 
    - Under the existing 
- What transportation measures would help address these challenges?
    - Could a fleet of EV-AVs be economically/efficiently dispatched to meet 100% of mobility requirements in micropolitan zones?
        - Economic: What is the economic burden of transportation in micropolitan communities?
        - Technical: How equipped are micropolitan zones to support a fully electrified LDV fleet?
    - Could remote work policies and rural broadband (e.g. Oklahoma and "brain gain" effects) reduce local mobility?  Are there levers to create "zoom-towns" and bring in economic diversity?
    - How can zoning in urban-wildlife interfaces be transportation friendly or reduce mobility burdens?
