- Public Use Micro-data Sample (PUMS)
- [California Statewide Household Travel Survey (CSHTS)]()
- Caltrans Transportation Planning (Mostly leads to "Under Development links"): https://dot.ca.gov/programs/transportation-planning
- [California Traffic Census Program](https://dot.ca.gov/programs/traffic-operations/census): Annual average daily traffic for all state-owned highways (trucks and totals).  Note that ahead is northbound/eastbound and back is southbound/westbound.

## Interesting Background and Reading

California Regional Transportation Planning Agencies:

- [Transportation Performance Measures for Rural Counties in California](https://www.nctc.ca.gov/documents/Reports/RCTF/RCTF%20Final%20Report%20Performance%20Monitoring%20Indicators%20Study%20Sept.%202015%20Kittelson%20and%20Assoc..pdf)

    - Recommendations for TPMs in rural California. This is very similar to what I thought I could form a thesis around.

Non California Initiatives:

- [ROUTES Initiative](https://www.transportation.gov/rural)
- [Minnesota Pathways to Transportation Decarb](https://www.dot.state.mn.us/sustainability/docs/pathways-report-2019.pdf): Minnesota is a fairly rural state, though many recommendations here are focused around the twin cities region.  Rural decarbonisation includes adding 

Interesting Analyses:

- [Complete Streets Policies](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/app/legacy/documents/cs/resources/cs-policyanalysis.pdf) : A complete street is a transportation concept that looks at transportation networks w.r.t. actual enduses and users instead of traditional categorization of "highway" vs "road" vs "bike path" etc.  One goal is to ensure all commuters who use physical transportation networks have equal access to safety and reliability.  A score is assigned based on a matrix of users, and recommendations can be built on top of shortfalls for actual street enduses.

- [SOCIETAL AND POLICY ISSUES: DECARBONIZATION AND RESOURCE PERIPHERIES](https://www.nap.edu/read/25656/chapter/9#73): Julia Haggerty from Montana State University talks about challenges to rural decarb.

Urban Growth Boundaries and Local Agency Formation:

- [CALAFCO](https://calafco.org/): LAFCOs are responsible for setting urban boundaries, planning city and population growth in urban areas as well as drawing lines for "service boundaries".  Long term land use planning often occur at the LAFCO level.  The california association of LAFCOs [provides a listing of all California LAFCOs](https://calafco.org/about-us/lafco-directory).
