# Regional Transportation Planning

Most long term planning in California falls to a network of transportation commissions that serve either a metropolitan area or larger regional area.  [Under SB 375, RTPAs are also required to include a sustainable communities section](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/sustainable-communities-program/what-are-sustainable-communities-strategies) as part of their transportation planning process (e.g. SB 375 and sustainable communities sections to reduce GHG emissions.)

## Transportation Performance Measures

MAPS-21 (2016) required federally mandated RTPs report and outline transportation performance measures (TPMs).  Performance measures aim to target specific goals, e.g. number of accidents, travel time, VMT reduced.  State transportation departments are responsible for setting guidelines in the RTP process, sometimes including what TPMs to use and how to measure them.  A TPM can be evaluated on a measurement or modeling basis.  Measurement-based TPMs typically require some direct measurement in the field such as traffic volume.  Model based TPMs are used to model uncertain futures such as transportation demand under certain conditions.

### Issues with Performance Measurement

## MPOs and RTPAs

Under [81 FR 34049](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/27/2016-11964/statewide-and-nonmetropolitan-transportation-planning-metropolitan-transportation-planning), state transportation departments are required to facilitate the creation of metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) and regional transportation planning agencies (RTPA).  The emphasis on RTPAs are a consequence of the MAP-21 act and the FAST act.  

Per 81 FR 34049, California facilitates the creation and registration of RTPAs and MPOs.  The state is also required to provide [guidelines on drafting RTPs](https://catc.ca.gov/programs/transportation-planning).  [California RTPAs/MPOs](https://dot.ca.gov/programs/transportation-planning/multi-modal-system-planning/system-planning/corridor-planning/metropolitan-planning-organization-regional-transportation-planning-agency-links) are listed by the California department of transportation.  

Of note are the "Big Four" MPOs - SANDAG (San Diego), SCAG (LA and surrounding area), MTC (9 Bay Area counties), SACOG (Sacramento and surrounding area) which are responsible for a vast majority of statewide transportation planning.
