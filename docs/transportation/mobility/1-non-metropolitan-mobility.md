# Non Urban Metropolitan Mobility

Many new mobility measures to increase transportation efficiency, or reduce transportation demand are not practical outside of urban metropolitan areas.  Roughly 10% of the US population lives within a ["micropolitan statistical area"](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2012/dec/c2010sr-01.pdf).  

## Micropolitan Statistical Areas

### Major Challenges

- Population centers are sprawling and have longer/more distant commute times
- Commerce highly dependenton Arterial roadways

## Rural Mobility

TODO: This is apparently different and separate from micropolitan-urban.  Rural has its own set of challenges (that frankly are more difficult to address.)
