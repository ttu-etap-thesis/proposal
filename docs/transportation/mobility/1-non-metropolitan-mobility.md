# Non Urban Metropolitan Mobility

Many new mobility measures to increase transportation efficiency, or reduce transportation demand are not practical outside of urban metropolitan areas.  Roughly 10% of the US population lives within a ["micropolitan statistical area"](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2012/dec/c2010sr-01.pdf).  In California, 97% of the population lives in a metropolitan statistical area, with 3% living in unincorporated or micropolitan statistical areas.

## Major Challenges to Non-Urban Mobility

- Population centers are sprawling and have longer/more distant commute times
    - Measure costs that manifest as higher consumer prices disproportionately affect non-urban residents
- Commerce highly dependenton Arterial roadways
- Due to demographic differences, fatalities on rural transportation networks tend to be much higher.
    - Elderly and disabled residents are particularly affected with transportation access
- Many state-wide transportation performance measures rely on population volume and are not normalized on a comparison basis, favoring urban areas for investment consideration (e.g. under the Caltrans Cost-benefit tool.)

A conceptual framework for looking at non-metro mobility (from the TCI in the NE):

- Emissions Reductions
- Accessibility and Equity: Rural regions face accesibility changes due to lower demand densities and longer distances
- Economy: Economic diversity and resilience often tied to personal mobility
- Health & Safety: Rural regions tend to see higher death rates per VMT


## Differenecs in Metro and non-Metro Transportation

- Rural and small urban areas are more concerned with maintaining aging infrastructure and safety as opposed to mode split and congestion.
- System reliability in rural and small urban areas are non-recurrent events (peak tourism seasons, construction, weather, diasster), whereas in metropolitans, reliability is centered around daily weekday usage.


## Mobility Initatives of Interest

- Complete Streets: by enabling all transportation modes in the transit system at the street level, the transportation network is able to provide support for multiple transit modes.


## Potential Research Questions

- Pathways to rural transportation decarbonisation?
- Non-metropolitan complete streets with demand-responsive AV transportation.
