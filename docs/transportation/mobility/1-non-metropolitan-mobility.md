# Non Urban Metropolitan Mobility

Many new mobility measures to increase transportation efficiency, or reduce transportation demand are not practical outside of urban metropolitan areas.  Roughly 10% of the US population lives within a ["micropolitan statistical area"](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2012/dec/c2010sr-01.pdf).  In California, 97% of the population lives in a metropolitan statistical area, with 3% living in unincorporated or micropolitan areas.

## Major Challenges to Non-Urban Mobility

- Population centers are sprawling and have longer/more distant commute times
    - Measure costs that manifest as higher consumer prices disproportionately affect non-urban residents
- Commerce highly dependenton Arterial roadways
- Due to demographic differences, fatalities on rural transportation networks tend to be much higher.
    - Elderly and disabled residents are particularly affected with transportation access

A conceptual framework for looking at non-metro mobility (from the TCI in the NE):

- Emissions Reductions
- Accessibility and Equity: Rural regions face accesibility changes due to lower demand densities and longer distances
- Economy: Economic diversity and resilience often tied to personal mobility
- Health & Safety: Rural regions tend to see higher death rates per VMT

### Existing Measures and Solutions

Mobility:

- Encourage adoption of clean mobility technologies (e.g. BEVs)
- Converting public vehicle fleets to clean technologies
- Building out intra-regional and local public transit systems;
- Universal broadband
- Infill development and Mixed-use development (complete streets pollicies)
- Refrigerant standard
- Build out multi-modal transit

Freight:

- APUs or electrification of freight pass-through and truck stops
- Increase rail and marine transportation

Interesting Analyses:

- [Complete Streets Policies](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/app/legacy/documents/cs/resources/cs-policyanalysis.pdf) : A complete street is a transportation concept that looks at transportation networks w.r.t. actual enduses and users instead of traditional categorization of "highway" vs "road" vs "bike path" etc.  One goal is to ensure all commuters who use physical transportation networks have equal access to safety and reliability.  A score is assigned based on a matrix of users, and recommendations can be built on top of shortfalls for actual street enduses.
