- Trucking
- Aviation
- Rail
- Shipping

## Shipping

Shipping Categories:

- Bulk Carriers
- Container Ships
- Tankers
- Gas Carriers
- General (Ferries, cruises, fishing, etc.)

### Terms

- [EEDI](http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/AirPollution/Pages/Technical-and-Operational-Measures.aspx): Energy Efficiency Design Index used to measure shipping fuel efficiency for ships built after 2013.  EEDI targets are set as a voluntary standard by the International Maritime Organisation.  Existing EEDI standards attempt to push [EEDI 30% below baseline](https://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/publications/Statistical%20analysis%20of%20the%20energy%20efficiency%20performance%20%28EEDI%29%20of%20new%20ships.pdf) by 2025. 

### Operational Measures

#### Slow Steaming

Slow steaming involves reducing ship engine speeds.

### Technology Measures

#### Alternative Fuels

Primary energy use is driven mostly by least-cost fuels.  Today, the majority of ships are fueld by heavy fuel oil due to price and energy density.  Commercial viability of alternatives to cheap HFO are needed to decarbonise primary energy use.

- Green Hydrogen
- Green Ammonia
- Biofuels
- Methanol
- Batteries
- Nuclear
