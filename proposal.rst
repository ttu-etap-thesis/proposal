Proposal
========

The central question of this thesis is as follows: Can public DRT services could meet mobility demands in non-urban metropolitan communities in lieu of existing personal vehicle travel and existing fixed-route public transit systems?

Additionally, this thesis aims to understand non-mobility issues of a public DRT services such as:

- What grid services or burdens would a public DRT fleet present (both autonomous and non-autonomous fleets)?
- What are the potential emissions benefits or harms from rural or micropolitan DRT services compared to traditional public transit systems and personal vehicle travel?
- What fiscal impacts or pressures would a public DRT service create for local transportation budgets?
- What safety impacts implications are there from 

Methods and Approaches
----------------------

The proposed approach is to leverage an :abbr:`ABM (Agent Based Model)` :cite:`Evans2013` to simulate different DRT networks and designs in a set of small cities and towns.  The ABM will simulate many "possible realities" of how different population characteristics such as mode choice preferences and different geospatial distributions of travel demand origins and destinations would affect adoption and level of service.  Travel demand (defined as the set of tours each agent in a region requires in a 24 hour period, where each tour is composed of multiple trips each leg of which has a travel mode) will initially be characterized by public survey data such as the California Household Travel Survey :cite:`NREL2017`, and the national transit database :cite:`FederalTransitAdministration2020`.

Goals and Desired Outcomes
==========================

This thesis aims to produce the following artifacts:

- A catalog of different DRT service architectures and designs (differing on vehicle size, fleet size, dispatch methods, payment schedules, and potential coverage goals.)
- Estimates of regionally specific travel demand profiles for non-metropolitan California communities based on household survey data, and determine required DRT fleet characteristics to meet said travel demand requirements
- A model for determining charging strategies for different DRT fleets for quantifying electricity sector benefits and harms from expanded use of flexible dispatch fleets.
- A model for evaluating DRT cost effectiveness in various contexts of geographical and population characteristics.
