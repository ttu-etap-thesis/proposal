Background
==========

California's current clean transportation strategy revolves around 3 approaches -- (1) Facilitating a transition from fossil fuel powered vehicles to electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, (2) decreasing emissions per VMT through the use of fuel efficiency standards and low carbon fuel standards and finally (3) the use of transportation demand management to reduce total VMT demand.  While fuel switching efforts are important and should remain a central pillar of clean transportation strategy, new conceptions of vehicle ownership and new modes for individuals to participate in the transportation system show tremendous promise in accelerating mobility decarbonisation.  Nationwide, an order of magnitude reduction in the fleet size of personal mobility vehicles is possible if all mobility were instead served by shared autonomous electric vehicles :cite:`Sheppard2019`.  At the core of many shared vehicle fleets is the idea of :abbr:`DRT (Demand responsive transit)`.  :abbr:`DRT (Demand responsive transit)` is a system of shared private or public transport where routes and schedules are not fixed :cite:`DepartmentofTransportation2020`.  A DRT service is typically associated with a mobility-as-a-service provider in the form of a :abbr:`TNC (Transportation Network Company)` such as Uber, Lyft, Chariot, Via, etc.  Most TNCs operate off a shared fleet of privately owned vehicles where drivers (vehicle owners) are paid by passengers via the TNC, often at lower cost than a traditional taxi service, or at comparable costs to public transit fares.  The financial viability of transportation network companies is questionable :cite:`Hawkins2019`, but does not underscore the success of the model in meeting mobility needs without requiring personal vehicle use for passengers.  However, private TNCs have traditionally not performed well outside of non metropolitan areas :cite:`Shirkant2019` (measured by economic success, they have not fared well within metros either.) 

A DRT system could more efficiently meet mobility demand and improve emissions per :abbr:`PMT (Person Miles Traveled)`.  Public DRT services are not new - many public transit agencies currently support dial-a-ride and paratransit services.  Recent trends in the public transit space are bringing DRT services to serve general ridership as well, such as the SmaRT Ride program :cite:`SacramentoRegionalTransit` in Sacramento.  Public/private TNC partnerships replace traditional large capacity vehicles on fixed routes with smaller "microtransit" vans and microbuses that fill closer to capacity on flexible routes and timetables.  Outside the U.S., DRT programs have shown successs in connecting disparate communities such as in the English countryside :cite:`Laws`.  DRT services have the potential to fulfill a niche in general ridership where traditional fixed route services would otherwise not perform well and should be understood further as one potential measure local transportation planning agencies could deploy to meet sustainable transportation goals.
