Motivation
==========

The success of transportation network companies (TNCs) in the past decade has cemented the technical viability of a real-time dispatchable fleet to serve every day mobility.  However, these widespread deployment to rural communities has been hampered by financial viability :cite:`Hawkins2019`.  Rural communities continue to be underserved by traditional fixed route public transit systems [#]_, and many rural households lack access to personal transportation [#]_.  This thesis aims to explore the potential for public demand responsive transit (DRT) as a means of better serving transportation needs unique to rural communities.
