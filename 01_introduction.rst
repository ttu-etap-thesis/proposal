Motivation
==========

The success of transportation network companies (TNCs) in the past decade has cemented the technical viability of a real-time dispatchable fleet to serve every day mobility.  TNCs demonstrate the technical and operational viability using large distributed fleets to provide Mobility on Demand (MOD), as well as a certain level of cultural acceptance as a transportation mode alternative to single-occupancy vehicles.  Despite their success in hyper-dense urban environments, their widespread deployment within rural communities by private TNC providers (e.g. Lyft and Uber) has been hampered by financial viability :cite:`Hawkins2019`.  This opens the question of how non-metropolitan communities could benefit from 21st century mobility trends.  One possibility is for mobility on demand services to provide improved transportation access within rural communities by supplementing or replacing low-density fixed route public transit systems [#]_ [#]_ and to enable mobility access to households that otherwise lack access to personal transportation modes [#]_.  This thesis aims to evaluate the potential for using microtransit, a technology-enabled demand responsive transit service using multi-passenger shuttles and/or vans :cite:`Shaheen2020`, to expand transportation access and serve mobility needs in Humboldt county.
