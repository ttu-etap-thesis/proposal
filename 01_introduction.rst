Motivation
==========

In the past decade, transportation network companies (TNCs) have introduced new technologies which have drastically altered the urban mobility space.  TNCs have demonstrated the technical and operational viability using distributed fleets to provide Mobility on Demand (MOD) at scale.  Despite their success in hyper-dense urban environments, their widespread deployment within rural communities has been hampered by financial viability :cite:`Hawkins2019`.  This opens the question of how non-metropolitan communities could benefit from novel MOD technologies.  One possibility is for mobility on demand services to provide improved transportation access within rural communities by supplementing or replacing low-density fixed route public transit systems [#]_ [#]_ and to expand mobility options for households that otherwise lack access to personal transportation modes [#]_.  This thesis aims to evaluate the potential for using microtransit, a type of technology-enabled mobility on demand transit service using multi-passenger shuttles and/or vans :cite:`Shaheen2020`, to expand transportation access and serve mobility needs in Humboldt county.
