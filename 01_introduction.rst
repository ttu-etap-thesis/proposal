Motivation
==========

The success of transportation network companies (TNCs) in the past decade has cemented the technical viability of a real-time dispatchable fleet to serve every day mobility.  TNCs demonstrate the technical and operational viability using large distributed fleets to provide Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS), as well as a certain level of cultural acceptance as a transportation mode alternative to single-occupancy vehicles.  Despite their success in hyper-dense urban environments, their widespread deployment within rural communities has been hampered by financial viability :cite:`Hawkins2019`.  Demand responsive transit (DRT), similar to services provided by TNCs, could serve as a valuable transit option to rural communities which are under-served by traditional fixed route public transit systems [#]_ and populations that lack access to personal transportation modes [#]_.  This thesis aims to explore the potential for public demand responsive transit as a means of expanding transportation access and serving transportation needs unique to challenges faced by rural communities.
