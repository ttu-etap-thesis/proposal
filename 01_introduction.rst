.. The introduction should describe some context that your question is interested in.

Motivation
==========

California's transportation sector produces more emissions than any other sector , with light duty vehicles alone making up 28% of the state's total emissions :cite:`Brown2020`.  Future VMT and mobility demand growth :cite:`Brown2020` will present significant challenges to achieving near term emissions reductions goals.
 
The hope for this thesis is to develop some understanding of how innovations in the TNC space could be deployed in a public transit context to better serve mobility needs.  This thesis aims to focus specifically on novel public transit deployments that are demand responsive in nature aimed at smaller populations.  The past decade has seen the rise of transportation network companies (TNCs) and new business models to encourage fleet sharing.  

The success of TNCs has cemented the technical viability of a real-time dispatchable fleet to serve every day mobility.  However, TNCs have also introduced significant ethical concerns over treatment of workers (:cite:`NewYorkTimes`, :cite:`Rao`) and created what some technology journalists have dubbed the "menace economy" :cite:`Galloway`.  Furthermore, the financial viability of transportation network companies is still questionable :cite:`Hawkins2019`.  

Nonetheless, the participation of private fleets to support real-time responsive public mobility is an exciting innovation.  The practice has significantly expanded mobility access without introducing new personal vehicles into the market :cite:`Shaheen2018`.

Public Policy Context
---------------------

- SB-743 shifts transportation project analysis from level of service to VMT, which electrification doesn't solve; more options needed for VMT reduction
- - level of service : might mean congestion in urban areas, but mobility (can people get to where they need) is another measure
- Problems with focusing on VMT reduction
  - Geography can necessitate increases in VMT
  - Populations already lacking mobility access can't/shouldn't reduce VMT


Limitations of Private VMTs
---------------------------

- Not obligated to serve areas that aren't profitable
- ~Worker rights issues exacerbating income inequality and what Swisher/Galloway dub the "menace economy"~

.. note:: Revision Comments

  - Climate angle: DRPT is a means of getting populations out of vehicle ownership; counterfactual would be purchasing +operating a car.  If fleet serving mobility is also electric, then you are also fuel switching. More opportunity in rural regions because IMC is negative for gasoline powered cars.
  - Societal angle: this is another tool/project to increase access and accessibility to public transportation infrastructure.
  - How much further could PT push into rural regions if you had some kind of DRPT system?
  - How much more could we expand PT?

Purpose
-------

This motivates the question of whether these innovations can be applied to public transportation as a public option for decarbonsing personal mobility.
