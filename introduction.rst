Purpose
=======

This document was prepared to produce a proposal pursuant toward a M.S. in the Energy, Technology and Policy program at Humboldt State University.

Motivation
----------

California's transportation sector produces more emissions than any other sector , with light duty vehicles alone making up 28% of the state's total emissions :cite:`Brown2020`.  Future VMT demand is expected to grow :cite:`Brown2020`, while simultaneously, the deployment of EVs and EV infrastructure thus far is subject to equity issues :cite:`Hsu2019`.  The hope for this thesis is to develop some understanding of how trends in vehicle electrification, fleet sharing/ride hailing and autonomous vehicles can contribute to providing equitable, carbon free mobility access in non metropolitan areas.
