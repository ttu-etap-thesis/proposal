Motivation
==========

California's transportation sector produces more emissions than any other sector , with light duty vehicles alone making up 28% of the state's total emissions :cite:`Brown2020`.  Future VMT and mobility demand growth :cite:`Brown2020` will present significant challenges to achieving near term emissions reductions goals.
 
The hope for this thesis is to develop some understanding of how innovations in the TNC space could be deployed in a public transit context to better serve mobility needs.  This thesis aims to focus specifically on novel public transit deployments that are demand responsive in nature aimed at smaller populations.  The past decade has seen the rise of transportation network companies (TNCs) and new business models to encourage fleet sharing. 

The success of TNCs has cemented the technical viability of a real-time dispatchable fleet to serve every day mobility.  However, TNCs have also introduced significant ethical concerns over treatment of workers (:cite:`NewYorkTimes`, :cite:`Rao`) and created what some technology journalists have dubbed the "menace economy" :cite:`Galloway`.  Furthermore, the financial viability of transportation network companies is still questionable :cite:`Hawkins2019`.  

Nonetheless, the participation of private fleets to support real-time responsive public mobility is an exciting innovation.  The practice has significantly expanded mobility access without introducing new personal vehicles into the market :cite:`Shaheen2018`.

Public Policy Context
---------------------

- SB-743 shifts transportation project analysis from level of service to VMT, which electrification doesn't solve; more options needed for VMT reduction
- 

Societal Issues from TNCs
-------------------------

- Not obligated to serve areas that aren't profitable
- Worker rights issues exacerbating income inequality and what Swisher/Galloway dub the "menace economy"


Purpose
-------

This motivates the question of whether these innovations can be applied to public transportation as a public option for decarbonsing personal mobility.
